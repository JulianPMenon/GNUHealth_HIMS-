GNU Health HMIS functionality
=============================

The main areas of GNU Health Hospital Management compnent are:

* **Community management**: demographics, domiciliary
  units, families, operational sectors, socioeconomics,...
* **Patient management (EMR)**: encounters, health evaluations,
  hospitalizations, clinical history, ...
* **Health center management (HMIS)**: Financial management, stock &
  pharmacy, human resources, ...
* **Laboratory Management (LIS)**: lab test orders, workflows, analyzer
  interfaces,  reports
* **Health Information System**: Reporting, demographics and epidemiology


These areas involve multi-disciplinary teams, with different responsibilities.
For example, demographics and status of the domiciliary units
(DU) can be collected by social workers. The patient management by health
professionals, the health center management by administrative personnel and
accountants, and the information produced by the health center can be
processed and managed by the health authorities.

This is just an example to show the importance of team work in GNU Health to get
the best results in your community.
