Introduction to Obstetrics
--------------------------


All information related to pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period can be found in the *Obstetric History* which can be accessed via the *Related* button in the *Patient* form. Due to the complexity of this information, it is not a section within the *Patient* form; to view or edit the obstetric history of a patient, click the *Relate* button in the toolbar and select *Obstetric History* instead. This will present you a list of all pregnancies of that patient.

The form for a single pregnancy has basically four sections:

* some general information (top and bottom of the form)
* a list with *Prenatal Evaluations*
* a list with * Perinatal and Intrapartum Information*
* a list with *Puerperium Monitor* records

.. _modulesindetail-obstetrics:obstetrics-general_pregnancy_information:

General Pregnancy Information
-----------------------------

The following fields allow you to store general information about a pregnancy:

* *Patient ID*: The name of the patient (link to a *Patient* record).
* *Health Prof*: The name of the doctor (link to a *Person* record).
* *Institution*: The health institution (link to a *Institution* record).
* *Pregnancy*: The number of the pregnancy for this patient. GNU Health will prevent you from using the same number twice; however, it will not force you to start with number 1 or to use consecutive numbers.
* *LMP*: The date of the last menstruation period.
* *Pregnancy Due Date*: The expected date of birth for the baby (automatically calculated based on the *LMP* date).
* *Current Pregnancy*: Check this box to indicate that this is the most recent pregnancy. GNU Heath will make sure that you have only one current pregnancy per patient. If you uncheck this box, the fields *End of Pregnancy* and *Result* must be filled in, because GNU Health assumes that this pregnancy has ended.
* *Fetuses*: The number of fetuses.
* *Monozygotic*: Check this box if a pregnancy consists of more than one fetus and they are monozygotic.
* *IUGR*: To indicate a intrauterine growth restriction. Choose between symmetric and asymmetric.
* *Warn*: Check this box if the pregancy is (or was) not normal.

The following fields are only available if the box *Current Pregnancy* has been unchecked:

* *Reverse*: Check this box if the patient does not know the date of her last menstruational period. This will make the field *Pr. Weeks* visible (see below).
* *End of Pregnancy*: The date when the pregnancy has ended.
* *Pr. Weeks*: The duration of the pregnancy in weeks. This field is only visible if you check the *Reverse* checkbox (see above). Entering a value in this field will delete the date in the *LMP* field (see above).
* *Result*: Choose between Live birth, Abortion, Stillbirth and Status unknown.
* *Home Birth*: Check to indicate if a patient gave birth at home.
* *BBA (Born Before Arrival)*: Check to indicate if a patient gave birth on her way to the health institution.
