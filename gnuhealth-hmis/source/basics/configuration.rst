The Configuration Section in GNU Health
---------------------------------------

In most databases – and GNU Health is no different here – there are two categories of data: Some data is created and updated permanently, while other data, once entered into the system, remains quite static. For example, during a working day in a hospital many new patients, evaluations, prescriptions and hospitalizations are stored in GNU Health. On the other hand, the staff of health professionals, the medicaments available in the pharmacy, the medical procedures provided or the hospital infrastructure (buildings, beds, operating rooms) will not change very much during a day, a week or even a month.

The second type of data is grouped in the *Health → Configuration* section, and this chapter provides an overview for this section. Since most configuration options are easier to understand in their context, you won't find too many details here but links to other chapters of this book where data from the *Configuration* section will be used.

Notes:

* The subsections available under the *Health → Configuration* section will vary depending on the modules installed in your system. This chapter describes the configuration options whith all GNU Health modules installed.
* There are configuration options on a more technical level too, relevant only to system administrators. These are not covered in this chapters since they are not part of the *Health → Configuration* section.

The following fields are available in a *Health Professionals* record:

* *Health Professional*: Link to a *Party* record. You can either select an existing record or create a new one. (Please note that only party records with the *Health Professional* flag can be found when searching. So if you can't find a party that exists already in your system, please check this flag before unintentionally creating a duplicate record.)

Note: In GNU Health, one health professional can only work for one health institution at a time. If you try to create a second *Health Professionals* record linking to the same *Party* record, you will get an error message.
