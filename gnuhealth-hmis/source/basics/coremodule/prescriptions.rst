About Prescriptions
-------------------

Prescriptons can be found in the *Health → Prescriptions* section of GNU Health. However, since in most cases you only need to see the prescriptions of a specific patient, the recommended way is to open a *Patient* record and to switch to *Prescriptions* using the *Relate* button.
