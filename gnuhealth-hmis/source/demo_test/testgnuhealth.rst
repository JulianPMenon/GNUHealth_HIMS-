Option 1: Connect to the Demo Database
--------------------------------------

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_1:_connect_to_the_demo_database-what_to_do:

What to do
^^^^^^^^^^

* Download and install the free Tryton client software on your computer.
* Start the Tryton client software and connect to the GNU Health Demo Database over the Internet.

:ref:`Please refer to this chapter <demo_test-demodb:the_demo_database>` for more information.

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_1:_connect_to_the_demo_database-advantages:

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

* This option is the quickest and simplest way for your first hands-on experience with GNU Health.
* The Tryton client is available for Windows, Mac OS and GNU/Linux.

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_1:_connect_to_the_demo_database-disadvantages:

Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* You have to be connected to the Internet.
* The Demo Database will be reset periodically, which is not ideal for a long-term test.
* You are sharing the Demo Database with other users, so they might interfere with your data.

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_2:_run_gnu_health_from_cd/dvd_or_usb_stick:

Option 2: Run GNU Health from CD/DVD or USB Stick
-------------------------------------------------

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_2:_run_gnu_health_from_cd/dvd_or_usb_stick-what_to_do:

What to do
^^^^^^^^^^

* Download the Live CD image and burn it to a CD/DVD or write it to an USB stick.
* Boot your computer from this CD/DVD or USB stick. This will turn your Windows computer temporarily into a GNU/Linux computer (e.g., an openSUSE operation system with KDE desktop environment) with a preinstalled GNU Health server including the Demo Database. 

:ref:`Please refer to this chapter <demo_test-livecd:the_live-cd>` for more information.

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_2:_run_gnu_health_from_cd/dvd_or_usb_stick-advantages:

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

* After the download you will not need an Internet connection anymore.
* This option gives you full access to the GNU Health server.
* You can install the system from the running Live-CD to your computer
* It is possible to setup your own database(s) besides the demo database (USB only)

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_2:_run_gnu_health_from_cd/dvd_or_usb_stick-disadvantages:

Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Booting and running a computer from a CD/DVD is slow. (It's quicker from the USB stick but still slow.)
* CD's cannot store much data(up to 650 MB/4.7-9.4 GB for DVD). This means that even if you do use a rewritable CD, you will be space-limited on what you can save.
* You need to know how to write a CD image to a CD or USB stick and how to change the boot sequence in the BIOS settings of your computer.
* Some computers do not allow for booting from CD or USB.
* While using the Live CD you don't have access to the programs on your computer, so you can't test GNU Health and work with your Windows applications in parallel.
* This method may not work on Apple-brand PCs.

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_3:_run_gnu_health_in_a_virtual_machine:

Option 3: Run GNU Health in a Virtual Machine
---------------------------------------------

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_3:_run_gnu_health_in_a_virtual_machine-what_to_do:

What to do
^^^^^^^^^^

* Download the virtual machine image to your harddisk and unpack it. (The virtual machine image can be found on the same webpage like the Live CD image â€“ see option 2.)
* Download and install the VirtualBox software (or any other emulator) on your computer.
* Run VirtualBox, locate the virtual machine image and start your virtual machine.

:ref:`Please refer to this chapter <demo_test-livecd:virtual_machine_images>` for more information.

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_3:_run_gnu_health_in_a_virtual_machine-advantages:

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

* This option gives you all advantages of the Live CD (option 2) without its disadvantages.
* The VM can serve as a base for a later production use.

.. _demo_test-testgnuhealth:different_ways_to_test_gnu_health-option_3:_run_gnu_health_in_a_virtual_machine-disadvantages:

Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The virtual machine is stored on your harddrive. Therefore it needs a bit more effort to pass the test installation to someone else compared to the Live CD.
* The performance will be slower as the virtual machine is also sharing the power of your machine.
