.. _appendix-faq:faq-general_questions-on_which_operating_systems_can_gnu_health_be_installed?:

On which operating systems can GNU Health be installed?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GNU Health server can be installed in any GNU/Linux and *NIX based systems* with a `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ interpreter. Some people have installed GNU Health server on Microsoft Windows.

The client can be installed in GNU/Linux systems, OpenBSD, FreeBSD  and other *NIX systems*, as well as in Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X (Macs with Intel processors only).

.. _appendix-faq:faq-general_questions-what_is_the_software_versioning_model_in_gnu_health?:

What is the software versioning model in GNU Health?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GNU Health uses a sequence-based schema, using the :code:`major.minor.revision` identifiers. GNU Health uses *odd* minor numbers for development versions, and *even* minor numbers for stable releases.

For example: 3.16.1 would correspond to a stable release, whereas 2.15.0 would be a development release. Development releases are not meant to be used in productive environments, and they are intended to be used by developers.

* Make sure that you are using the correct version of the client. This is not necessarily the most recent version. Please refer to the chapter about the :ref:`demo_test-demodb:the_demo_database`.

* Make sure your Internet connection is up and running. (Temporary communication problems between the Tryton client and the Demo Database may be caused by unstable or very slow connectivity.)

Mailing lists

.. _appendix-faq:faq-mailing_lists-i_have_a_question_about_gnu_health,_what_is_the_best_way_to_ask_?:

I have a question about GNU Health, what is the best way to ask ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The GNU Health general mailing list is "health@gnu.org" . For general users (non-developers) this is the best place to start. You can subscribe here https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/health

.. _appendix-faq:faq-mailing_lists-what_is_the_right_format_for_emails_?:

What is the right format for emails ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please don't use HTML for emails. Use plain text

.. _appendix-faq:faq-mailing_lists-can_i_include_screenshots_in_my_mails_?:

Can I include screenshots in my mails ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please don't. They take a lot of space in our mailboxes. The best way is to upload the screenshot to your favorite image hosting community, and provide the link in the mail. One example is imgur.

.. _appendix-faq:faq-mailing_lists-what_is_the_recommended_way_to_reply_a_message_?:

What is the recommended way to reply a message ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We recommend using :wikipedia:`(inline) posting <Interleaved_style|interleaved>` when replying a message. 
Please respond to the specific mail, not to a daily "Digest" message. Replying to the digest "breaks" the thread and it is hard to contextualize the messages.

.. _appendix-faq:faq-mailing_lists-subjects_on_the_emails:

Subjects on the emails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please use short, concise and contextualized subjects when writing to the mailing lists.

As mentioned in the previous section, please don't use the "Digest" as the subject to reply.
