Administration
==============

This section does not describe the system administration of the servers but the administration part inside the GNU Health client.

At the lower end of the main navigation you will find the *Administration* section. This is the area where system administrators configure users (and their access rights), data structures (like models and fields), modules, elements of the user interface, or languages.

While the * Health â†’ :ref:`basics-configuration:configuration` * section is specific to GNU Health, the *Administration* section is a basic part of Tryton. And while the Configuration section will be managed by medical or administrative staff of a health institution, the *Administration* section is under the control of IT staff.
