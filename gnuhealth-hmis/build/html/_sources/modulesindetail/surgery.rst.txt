Introduction to Surgery
-----------------------

GNU Health allows you to document all surgical procedures performed per patient and in a health institution overall. It uses the ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) of the World Health Organization (WHO) to identify the type of surgery.

.. _modulesindetail-surgery:surgery-introduction_to_surgery-icd-10-pcs:

ICD-10-PCS
^^^^^^^^^^

The ICD-10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) is a World Health Organization medical classification used for procedural codes. When procedures are performed for specific diseases or disorders, the disease or disorder is not contained in the procedure code. There are no codes for procedures exclusive to aneurysms, cleft lip, strictures, neoplasms, hernias, etc. The diagnosis codes, not the procedure codes, specify the disease or disorder.

Surgeries per Patient
---------------------


To view and edit the surgeries of a specific patient, open the *Patients* form and switch to the *Surgeries* tab in the lower half of the form. There you will find a list of all surgical procedures this patient had (if any).

The list view provides the following information:

* *Description*
* *Base Condition*
* *Urgency*
* *Date* (including Time)
* *Duration*
* *Operation Room*
* *Age* of the patient at the time of the surgery
* *Institution*

To see the full record, double click on a list entry. This will bring up the *Surgery* form (see below).

To add a new *Surgeries* record, click the *Relate* button from the toolbar and choose *Surgeries*. This will open the list in a new window where you are able to add new records.

All Surgeries
-------------

In the *Health â†’ Surgeries* section you will find a list of all surgeries in the system. This is the way to look for a surgery when you don't know the name of the patient, and it allows you to get a broader picture of what is going on in the operation room.

The columns of that list are the same as in the *Patients* form (see above). To see the full record, double click on a list entry. This will bring up the *Surgery* form (see below).

*Surgeries* Form
----------------



For every surgery you can store the following information:

* *Patient*: Link to a *Patient* record.
* *Date* (including time)
* *Age* of the patient at the time of the surgery: Calculated based on the date of birth and the date of the surgery.
* *Code*
* *Description*
* *Base Condition*: Link to a *Diseases* record.
* *Urgency*: Choose between "Optional", "Required", "Urgent", or "Emergency".
* *Operating Room*: Link to an *Operating Room* record (see :ref:`Health Institutions: Operating Rooms<basics-coremodule-healthinstitutions:health_institutions-health_institution_facilities-operating_rooms>`).
* *Surgeon*: Link to the health professional who was responsible for the surgery.
* *Anesthesist*: Link to the health professional who was responsible for the anesthesia.
* *Patient Surgical Risk Assessment* section:

	* *ASA PS*: Choose between "PS1: Normal healthy patient", "PS2: Patients with mild systemic disease", "PS3: Patients with severe systemic disease", "PS4: Patients with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life", "PS5: Moribund patients who are not expeted to survive without the operation", or "PS6: A declared brain-dead patient who organs are removed for donor purposes".
	* *RCRI*: See section "Revised Cardiac Risk Index" below.
	* *Mallampati Score*: In anesthesia, the Mallampati score is used to predict the ease of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the oral cavity. A higher Mallampati score is associated with more difficult intubation as well as a higher incidence of sleep apnea. Choose between "Class 1", "Class 2", "Class 3", or "Class 4".

* *Preoperative Checklist* section:

	* *Risk of Massive Bleeding*: Check if appropriate
	* *Pulse Oximeter in Place*: Check if appropriate
	* *Surgical Site Marking*: Check if appropriate
	* *Antibiotic Prophylaxis*: Check if appropriate
	* *Sterility Confirmed*: Check if appropriate

* *Procedures* section: As we can see in the screenshot, GNU Health helps you searching the procedure using a filter with two different categories, code and long text.

	* *Code*
	* *Notes*
	
* *Details / Incidents*
* *Anesthesia*
* *End*
* *Duration*
* *State*: As long as the record is not signed, the state is "In progress". As soon as you click the *Sign* button, the state will change to "Done".
* *Signed by*: As soon as the record is signed it will show the name of the signing health professional where the *Sign* button was.

Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The :wikipedia:`Revised Cardiac Risk Index` (RCRI) is a method to indicate a patient's risk for perioperative cardiac complications. The RCRI *Score* and *Class* are entered via a dialog which allows you to indicate the following risk factors:

* *High Risk Surgery*
* *Preoperative Diabetes*
* *History of Ischemic Heart Disease*
* *History of Cerebrovascular Heart Disease*
* *History of Congestive Heart Disease*
* *Preoperative Kidney Disease*

Based on this data, GNU Health automatically calculates the *Score* (0 .. 6) and the *RCRI Class* (I .. IV).
