Inpatient Management
====================

.. _modulesindetail-inpatientmanagement:inpatient_management-introduction_to_inpatient_management:

Introduction to Inpatient Management
------------------------------------

If a patient is not only seeing a doctor (outpatient) but staying at the hospital (inpatient), you have to manage a lot more information about this patient. This information is stored in *Hospitalizations* records which can be found in the *Health → Hospitalizations* section of GNU Health. For each stay at the hospital you create a separate *Hospitalizations* record.

Note: To use the functionality described in this chapter you must have the modules :code:`health_inpatient` and :code:`health_inpatient_calendar` installed. (:ref:`More information about modules.<hmis-administration-modules:modules>`)

.. _modulesindetail-inpatientmanagement:inpatient_management-admission_process:

Admission Process
-----------------

At the moment a patient is becoming an inpatient you basically need two things to handle the admission in GNU Health: a *Patients* record and a *Hospitalizations* record. If the *Patients* record does not exist already, create one first (for more information see the :ref:`patientmanagement-patientmanagement:introduction_to_patient_management` chapter). Then, create a *Hospitalizations* record.

.. _modulesindetail-inpatientmanagement:inpatient_management-*administrative_data*_tab:

*Administrative Data* Tab
-------------------------

In the *Administrative Data* tab you can store the following data:

* *Registration Code*
* *Patient*: A link to a *Patients* record (mandatory).
* *Hospital Bed*: A link to a bed (mandatory). For details, see the "Assigning a Bed" section below.
* *Hospitalization Date*: mandatory
* *Expected Discharge Date*: mandatory
* *Calendar Event*
* *Attending Physician*
* *Operating Physician*
* *Admission Type*: mandatory
* *Reason for Admission*
* *Extra Info*
* *Transfer History*

Assigning a Bed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For obvious reasons you can not hospitalize a patient without assigning him a free bed. This happens in the *Hospital Bed* field, where you link the *Hospitalization* record to a *Bed* record. (For more information about how to configure beds in your system, please refer to :ref:`Health Institutions: Beds <basics-coremodule-healthinstitutions:health_institutions-health_institution_facilities-beds>`.)

There are mainly two ways to do this:

* If you already know the ID of the bed for this patient, then you can simply type this ID. As soon as you type, the system will offer you matching IDs to choose from.
* If you don't know the bed ID already and want to check for available beds first, click the button on the right hand side. This will present you a list with all beds including their availability status (free, occupied, reserved).

Once the bed is chosen the system will give you the option to confirm the admission and, if there is no error, the status will change to “confirmed”. 

It is important to emphasize that at this point if we check the beds section, this particular bed we just assigned will have a status of “reserved” and that it will change into “occupied” at the moment that we confirm the admission.

.. _modulesindetail-inpatientmanagement:inpatient_management-*nutrition*_tab:

*Nutrition* Tab
---------------

In the *Nutrition* tab you can find all information about eating habits and diets the patient must follow:

* *Belief*: Some religions have specific rules regarding the consumption of food. For example, Jews and Muslims are not allowed to eat pork meat. Therefore it may be helpful to indicate the belief of the patient here. Please note that this is a lookup field where you can select existing entries or create a new entry.
* *Vegetarian*: Choose from "None", "Vegetarian", "Lacto-Vegetarian", "Lacto-Ovo-Vegetarian", "Pescetarian", or "Vegan".
* *Meals / Diet Program*: Add any number of diets. Please note that the *Diet* field is a lookup field for a *Therapeutic Diet* record where you can select existing entries or create a new entry.
* *Other Nutrition Notes / Directions*
