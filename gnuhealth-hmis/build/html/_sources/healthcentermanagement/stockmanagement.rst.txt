Basics of Stock Management
--------------------------

Stock management contains all processes to track physical products within a company. This allows a company to tell which products in which quantities are on stock and in which location they can be found. The *Inventory & Stock* module of GNU Health allows to document any change in stock, be it a shipment from a supplier, a shipment to a customer, or simply a move from one location to another.

In the context of a health instution, stock management is especially useful for keeping track of medicaments available in the pharmacy.

.. _healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement:stock_management-stock_locations:

Stock Locations
---------------

Stock locations can be defined, edited, and deleted in the *Inventory & Stock → Locations* section. You can have as many locations as you need, and you can create hierarchical structures by assigning a parent location to a location.

There are six types of locations:

* *Storage:* Storage locations represent real places where products are stored.
* *Warehouse:* Warehouses are used to group several storage locations.
* *Customer:* Customer locations are virtual locations for products that have been sent to customers.
* *Supplier:* Supplier locations are virtual locations for products that have been received from suppliers.
* *Lost And Found:* Lost And Found locations are used for inventory gaps.

.. _healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement:stock_management-stock_movements:

Stock Movements
---------------

Whenever goods are transported from one location to another you create a move record in the *Inventory & Stock → Moves* section. There you basically indicate what amount of a certain product has been moved from one location to another, and at which date. By doing so you tell GNU Health to adapt the inventory of the two locations affected.

A move has one of the following states:

* *Draft:* A move that is planned for the future but still subject to modifications. Default state for new move records.
* *Assigned:* A move that will not be modified anymore. The products affected by the move will be reserved.
* *Done:* A move that has been performed in the real world.
* *Cancel:* A move that has been cancelled in *Draft* or *Assigned* state and therefore has never taken place in the real world.

Shipments
---------

A shipment is simply a group of several moves happening at the same date and around the same location.

.. _healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement:stock_management-inventories:

Inventories
-----------

An inventory is basically a list of all items in a certain stock location at a given time. It allows to control and update the quantities of the products in stock.

To create an inventory you enter a *Storage Location*, a *Lost and Found Location* and a *Date*. By clicking the *Complete Inventory* button a list with the expected quantities for each product in the location is created. If there is a difference between the expected quantities and the quantities in the real world (i.e. the number of products in the shelves), the real quantities can be entered. By clicking the *Confirm* button, move records are created to balance expected quantities and real ones.
