Since GNU Health 3.4, the HMIS client allows to use most of the functionality from the command line, without the need of the menu. It's much faster and direct than the previous menu-based client. Of course, the menu is still available.

Most commands accept arguments, so the user can go directly to one specific instance of the resource. For example

PAT : list all the people registered on the system

PAT ESPGNU777ORG : takes directly to the patient with federation account "ESPGNU777ORG"

Accessing the command line
--------------------------
The command line can be accessed by clicking on the Command Line box (either at the top or bottom left of the client).

Clicking **SHIFT + Z** will put the focus on the Command Line Interface section.
