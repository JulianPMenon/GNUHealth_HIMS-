<span id="healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement-stock-management-basics-of-stock-management"></span><h2>Basics of Stock Management<a class="headerlink" href="#basics-of-stock-management" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Stock management contains all processes to track physical products within a company. This allows a company to tell which products in which quantities are on stock and in which location they can be found. The <em>Inventory &amp; Stock</em> module of GNU Health allows to document any change in stock, be it a shipment from a supplier, a shipment to a customer, or simply a move from one location to another.</p>
<p>In the context of a health instution, stock management is especially useful for keeping track of medicaments available in the pharmacy.</p>
</section>
<section id="stock-locations">
<span id="healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement-stock-management-stock-locations"></span><h2>Stock Locations<a class="headerlink" href="#stock-locations" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Stock locations can be defined, edited, and deleted in the <em>Inventory &amp; Stock → Locations</em> section. You can have as many locations as you need, and you can create hierarchical structures by assigning a parent location to a location.</p>
<p>There are six types of locations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Storage:</em> Storage locations represent real places where products are stored.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Warehouse:</em> Warehouses are used to group several storage locations.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Customer:</em> Customer locations are virtual locations for products that have been sent to customers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Supplier:</em> Supplier locations are virtual locations for products that have been received from suppliers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Lost And Found:</em> Lost And Found locations are used for inventory gaps.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="stock-movements">
<span id="healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement-stock-management-stock-movements"></span><h2>Stock Movements<a class="headerlink" href="#stock-movements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Whenever goods are transported from one location to another you create a move record in the <em>Inventory &amp; Stock → Moves</em> section. There you basically indicate what amount of a certain product has been moved from one location to another, and at which date. By doing so you tell GNU Health to adapt the inventory of the two locations affected.</p>
<p>A move has one of the following states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Draft:</em> A move that is planned for the future but still subject to modifications. Default state for new move records.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Assigned:</em> A move that will not be modified anymore. The products affected by the move will be reserved.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Done:</em> A move that has been performed in the real world.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Cancel:</em> A move that has been cancelled in <em>Draft</em> or <em>Assigned</em> state and therefore has never taken place in the real world.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="shipments">
<span id="healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement-stock-management-shipments"></span><h2>Shipments<a class="headerlink" href="#shipments" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A shipment is simply a group of several moves happening at the same date and around the same location.</p>

<span id="healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement-stock-management-shipments-supplier-shipments"></span><h3>Supplier Shipments<a class="headerlink" href="#supplier-shipments" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A supplier shipment record is created when products are received from a supplier. It contains information about the <em>Supplier,</em> the <em>Warehouse</em> in which the products are coming, the <em>Planned Date</em> and the <em>Effective Date</em> of the shipment. In addition, a supplier shipments contains <em>Incoming Moves</em> (moves between the supplier location and the input location of the warehouse) and <em>Inventory Moves</em> (moves between the input location and the storage location of the warehouse).</p>
<p>A supplier shipment has one of the following states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Draft:</em> Incoming moves and inventory moves are in <em>Draft</em> state.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Received:</em> Incoming move are set in state <em>Done</em>, inventory moves are created if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Done:</em> Inventory moves and incoming moves are in <em>Done</em> state.</p></li>

In addition, a customer shipment contains <em>Inventory moves</em> (moves between the storage location and the output location of the warehouse) and <em>Outgoing Moves</em> (moves between the output location of the warehouse and the customer location).</p>
<p>A customer shipment has one of the following states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Draft:</em> Outgoing moves and inventory moves are in <em>Draft</em> state.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Waiting:</em> Inventory moves are created (or completed) to balance the outgoing moves. This shipment should be processed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Assigned:</em> Products have been assigned (or reserved) from the storage locations.</p></li>

<section id="inventories">
<span id="healthcentermanagement-stockmanagement-stock-management-inventories"></span><h2>Inventories<a class="headerlink" href="#inventories" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>An inventory is basically a list of all items in a certain stock location at a given time. It allows to control and update the quantities of the products in stock.</p>
<p>To create an inventory you enter a <em>Storage Location</em>, a <em>Lost and Found Location</em> and a <em>Date</em>. By clicking the <em>Complete Inventory</em> button a list with the expected quantities for each product in the location is created. If there is a difference between the expected quantities and the quantities in the real world (i.e. the number of products in the shelves), the real quantities can be entered. By clicking the <em>Confirm</em> button, move records are created to balance expected quantities and real ones.</p>
